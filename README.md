<b>Cursera Assignment: B4.2 Programming a Tag Following Algorithm</b>
For this assignment, you will be implementing the controller we covered this week to get your rover to follow a tag that you hold. To do this, set the goal as the position of the tag in the controller, so that the rover will try to move to the position of the controller. It should be robust enough to be able to follow the tag even as you move. Once this is working, please upload a video of your rover following a hand held tag. You will need to move the tag so that the rover will have to perform both a left hand turn and a right hand turn while following the tag.
